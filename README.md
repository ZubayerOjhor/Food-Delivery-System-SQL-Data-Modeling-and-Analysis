# Food Delivery System: SQL Data Modeling and Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents a case study where SQL is utilized to support Foodpanda's restaurant business team in tracking the performance of their new food brands. The case study involves data modeling and the creation of several key business metrics using SQL queries on datasets such as orders, vendors, products, and customers.

## Datasets
The following `.csv` files were used in this case study:
1. `orders.csv`
2. `vendors.csv`
3. `products.csv`
4. `customers.csv`

These datasets provide the foundation for generating valuable insights into Foodpanda's new food brands.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this case study are to:
1. Track the total number of successful orders per day.
2. Determine the number of customers who have placed at least one successful order.
3. Analyze the total number of successful orders per restaurant per day.
4. Calculate the average number of products ordered per order per day.
5. Identify the number of customers who have reordered at least once in the last 7 days.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries developed for this case study are structured to achieve the above objectives. Each query is crafted to transform raw data into meaningful metrics, providing the business with actionable insights.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For data modeling and query development.
- **Google BigQuery Sandbox**: Used as the environment for writing and testing SQL queries.
- **GitHub**: For version control and repository management.
